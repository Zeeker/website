During his career Sascha dabbled with a lot of things: over "classic" Java development, to crafting mobile and responsive web apps, over to building large scalable and resilient backend systems. For the past two years Elixir has been his language of choice for building aforementioned backend systems.

This talk aims to provide a glimpse into how Elixir came to be, what problems it tries to solve and how it solves them. Using concrete examples it will introduce the basic syntactic building blocks of the language and higher-level patterns defining applications built with Elixir.

After all this you should have a basic understanding on what makes Elixir tick and why it's a pleasure to use.
