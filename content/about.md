Sascha is a 28-year-old Software Developer from Cologne, Germany. He used to do full-stack iOS and web development but today focusses on building scalable, resilient, distributed backend systems at grandcentrix. Communication, compassion, and knowledge-sharing are all important topics for him, and he likes to think about how we can use them to build a better and more productive place to work.

In his free-time he is a loving husband, father and avid roleplayer. He reads a lot, loves a good science fiction movie and likes to engage in thought-provoking conversations from game design to system architecture or the meaning of life.
