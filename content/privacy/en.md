The content of a shopping basket in an online shop or a login status, for example, can be stored in such a cookie. Cookies are referred to as "permanent" or "persistent" and remain stored even after the browser is closed. For example, the login status can be saved if users visit it after several days. The interests of the users who are used for range measurement or marketing purposes can also be stored in such a cookie. Third party cookies" are cookies that are offered by providers other than the person responsible for operating the online service (otherwise, if they are only the latter's cookies, they are referred to as "first party cookies").  
  
We may use temporary and permanent cookies and explain this in our privacy policy.  

If we ask the user to consent to the use of cookies (e.g. in the context of a cookie consent), the legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a. DSGVO. Otherwise, the personal cookies of the users will be processed in accordance with the following explanations within the framework of this data protection declaration on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. of the German Data Protection Act).

If users do not wish cookies to be stored on their computer, they are asked to deactivate the corresponding option in the system settings of their browser. Stored cookies can be deleted in the system settings of the browser. The exclusion of cookies can lead to functional restrictions of this online offer.

To use the DISQUS comment function, users can log in via their own DISQUS user account or an existing social media account (e.g. OpenID, Facebook, Twitter or Google). DISQUS obtains the user's login data from the platforms. It is also possible to use the DISQUS comment function as a guest without creating or using a user account with DISQUS or one of the specified social media providers.  

We merely embed DISQUS and its functions into our website, whereby we can influence the comments of the users. However, the users enter into a direct contractual relationship with DISQUS, within the framework of which DISQUS processes the user's comments and is a contact person for any deletion of the user's data. We refer here to the DISQUS data protection declaration: [https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy) and also point out to the users that they can assume that DISQUS stores not only the comment content but also their IP address and the time of the comment as well as cookies on the user's computer and can use them to display advertisements.

### Retrieval of profile pictures from Gravatar

Gravatar is a service where users can register and store profile pictures and their e-mail addresses. If users leave contributions or comments with the respective e-mail address on other online presences (especially in blogs), their profile pictures can be displayed next to the contributions or comments. For this purpose, the e-mail address provided by the users is encrypted and transmitted to Gravatar for the purpose of checking whether a profile is stored for it. This is the only purpose of the transmission of the e-mail address and it is not used for other purposes, but deleted afterwards.  
  
Gravatar is used on the basis of our legitimate interests within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO, as we use Gravatar to offer authors of contributions and comments the opportunity to personalise their contributions with a profile picture.  
  
By displaying the images, Gravatar obtains the IP address of the user, as this is necessary for communication between a browser and an online service. More information on the collection and use of data by Gravatar can be found in Automattic's privacy policy: [https://automattic.com/privacy/](https://automattic.com/privacy/).  
  
If users do not want a user image associated with their Gravatar e-mail address to appear in the comments, they should use an e-mail address that is not registered with Gravatar to comment. We would also like to point out that it is also possible to use an anonymous e-mail address or no e-mail address at all if users do not wish their own e-mail address to be sent to Gravatar. Users can completely prevent the transmission of data by not using our comment system.

The information generated by the cookie about users' use of the website is generally transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.  
  
Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our website by users, to compile reports on activities within this website and to provide us with other services relating to the use of this website and the Internet. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created from the processed data.  
  
We use Google Analytics only with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the user is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.

Users' personal data will be deleted or anonymised after 14 months.

### Online presence in social media

We maintain online presences within social networks and platforms in order to be able to communicate with customers, interested parties and users active there and to inform them about our services.  
  
We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This can result in risks for users, as it could, for example, make it more difficult to enforce the rights of users. With regard to US providers that are certified under the Privacy Shield, we would like to point out that by doing so they commit themselves to comply with EU data protection standards.  
  
In addition, user data is usually processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created on the basis of user behavior and the resulting interests of users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements inside and outside the platforms that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the user's computer in which the user's usage behaviour and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can also be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (in particular if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).  
  
The processing of the personal data of the users takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests in effective information of the users and communication with the users in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 letter f. DSGVO. If the users are requested by the respective providers of the platforms to consent to the aforementioned data processing, the legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a., Art. 7 DSGVO.  
  
For a detailed description of the respective processing operations and the opt-out options, we refer to the following linked information of the providers.  
  
Also in the case of requests for information and the assertion of user rights, we point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate measures and give information. Should you nevertheless need help, you can contact us.
